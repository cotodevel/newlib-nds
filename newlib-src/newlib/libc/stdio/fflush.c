FUNCTION
<<fflush>>---flush buffered file output

INDEX
	fflush
INDEX
	_fflush_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	int fflush(FILE *<[fp]>);

	int _fflush_r(struct _reent *<[reent]>, FILE *<[fp]>);

DESCRIPTION
The <<stdio>> output functions can buffer output before delivering it
to the host system, in order to minimize the overhead of system calls.

Use <<fflush>> to deliver any such pending output (for the file
or stream identified by <[fp]>) to the host system.

If <[fp]> is <<NULL>>, <<fflush>> delivers pending output from all
open files.

Additionally, if <[fp]> is a seekable input stream visiting a file
descriptor, set the position of the file descriptor to match next
unread byte, useful for obeying POSIX semantics when ending a process
without consuming all input from the stream.

The alternate function <<_fflush_r>> is a reentrant version, where the
extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure, and
<[fp]> must not be NULL.

RETURNS
<<fflush>> returns <<0>> unless it encounters a write error; in that
situation, it returns <<EOF>>.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fflush>>.  The behavior on input streams is only
specified by POSIX, and not all implementations follow POSIX rules.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
