Windows 7+:

copy any mp4 video+audio files into 
/Release/tvsIn folder

then run:
/Release/TGDSTVSExport.bat

And all TGDS-Videoplayer .TVS video files will be generated at:
/Release/tvsout folder

Once conversion ends, remember to copy both the .tvs and the .ima file located in the /tvsout folder into SD, then use ToolchainGenericDS-multimediaplayer to play the video(s).
